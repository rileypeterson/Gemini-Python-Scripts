In the coming weeks, I will be making changes to the code to make it more accessible for public scientific use.  

Goals for the month of January:  
-Provide a full example using publicly available data  
-Resolve discrepancies with the inverse variance map and the current method for creating the sigma image
-Consider eliminating the dependency of pyraf in favor of astropy modules  
-Consider simplifying/revising/automating the refitting process
