# Gemini-Python-Scripts
Python scripts developed while working as an intern at the Gemini Observatory in Hilo, Hawaii.  
Manual.pdf - Users manual for Software  
GALFIT Wrapper - do_everything_v0.py  
Simulation Software -  make_sims.py  
Plotting and Analysis of Simulations - master_stats.py  

In the coming weeks, I will be making changes to the code to make it more accessible for public scientific use. Specifically, I think I will try to eliminate the dependency on using pyraf. I hope to provide some examples with publicly available data.
